# NHP-Project

This project explores the use of human caregivers as additional social enrichment for pair-housed Rhesus and CYnomolgus Macaques.
In this github, you will find the SAS code associated with this project, which can be divided into two types: Live Observation Data and Weekly Videos.
The live observations were taken daily from 1-2PM while treatment was applied. The files Live Observation Data_Scans, Live Observation Data_Scans2, and Scans -TW25MAR2022 correspond to this section.
Weekly videos were taken every Friday from 4-5PM. The files Abnormal Behaviour_TW25MAR2022, Behavioural contexts, and Social Behaviour -TW25MAR2022 correspond to this section.
